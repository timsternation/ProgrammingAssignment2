## This goal of this code is to enable the user to cache the
## inverse of a matrix once it has been calculated

## This function takes a matrix is input and creates an object
# that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y){
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the object created in
## the makeCacheMatrix function. Once the calculation has been
## performed, the user can use this function to retrieve the
## inverse from cached memory.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(m)
        m
}
